            <h3>Growing Up</h3>
            <p>
                When I was 6, I was choosing some new soccer cleats for my first season of organized soccer. My dad took me to Big5 and showed me a few cleats to pick from. The first one was a generic
                black and white adidas soccer cleat, the next was a navy blue cleat, and the last he showed me was a gray and white cleat. I then looked past him and pointed out these bright gold and red 
                adidas cleats. They were the flashiest cleats in the store, and I knew I had to get them. From there on out, I have always been drawn to bright shoes and have never settled for generic 
                looking shoes that were the most common in school, or on the field and basketball court. I started playing basketball around the same age, and I eventually quit soccer to focus primarily 
                on basketball. Growing up, I have been a Sacramento Kings fan, so it feels great to finally see them make the playoffs!

            <h3>Play Style</h3>
            <p>
                The most important part when researching basketball shoe reviews is, how does the reviewer play in them? My play style has stayed relatively the same since I started playing basketball. 
                I thrive off the 3 point line, and the majority of my shots occur here. My second most popular shot is the floated from outside the paint, followed my layups at the rim. I rarely take 
                fadeaway midrange shots in game. My game does not require much jumping, and I usually like to run around to get open off ball. When I have the ball I, a quick first step is essential to 
                my game, so I can beat my defender off the dribble. I also love to get my teammates involved, and I am constantly scanning the court looking for an open teammate. I typically play as a point 
                guard or shooting guard. With that said, the shoes that fit my game best are low cut/mid cut shoes that fall on the lighter side. I love a smooth cushion, but not too much, so I can stay 
                fast on the court. My performance reviews are geared around these aspects, so if your game is similar to mine, then I'm sure the reviews will fit your preferences the most.

            <h3> What I do when I'm not playing basketball</h3>
            <p>
                Although I wish I can play basketball every day, I am just not able to. I am a full time student pursuing a bachelor's of science in computer science from Oregon State University. I am 
                also a TA, so a lot of my time is dedicated to programming. My tip to other students is to perfect your time management. I have been able to fit basketball into my schedule a lot easier 
                when I am able to work ahead on my assignments, and not wait until the last minute to start them. In fact, my greatest motivation to finish my assignments early is, so I can play basketball 
                that week!
